Algorithm ideas for solving the "reverse the bible" problem in both iterative and recursive style

COMMON:
Read bible from text file(may need to break up into parts for memory constraints)

ITERATIVE:
put chapter into an array, switch places with character in oposite place

RECURSIVE:
rewrite bible in reverse order
